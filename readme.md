“The Bunker” is the title of a top-down shooter game written in the Python Programming language using Pygame. This program serves as a submission for the final project of the Algorithm and Programming class taken in BINUS International University. The objective of this project is the creation of an enjoyable video game experience, while using Python and Pygame to incorporate elements such as procedural generation and top-down gameplay.


  The goal of the game itself is to progress through sets of procedurally generated levels in order to reach and defeat the final boss. The gameplay consists of a player character moving through rooms, constantly fighting enemies using firearms, and finding “stairs” to progress to the next level, all the way until the boss. Should the player’s health reach zero due to enemy attacks, the user will be notified of their defeat and promptly be sent back to the menu, where they can start over through a new set of rooms. Should the player win, they will be rewarded with a congratulatory message, before being returned to the menu and given the chance to start again from the beginning.
